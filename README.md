# 🎬 Movie Rating API

This project is a Spring Boot REST API that allows users to:

- Fetch movie details and determine if it won the Best Picture Oscar 🏆
- Submit user ratings with validation (1–10)
- Retrieve the top 10 rated movies from the database
- Auto-populate data from the OMDb API when missing locally
